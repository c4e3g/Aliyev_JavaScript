Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 
-Can this sequence be considered correct? 
-If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct? 


Answer:
- For me, Basically, no, this sequence is not correct because the second opening bracket in the start and the second closing bracket from the end are not properly paired.
But if it comes to phylosophical logics, then based on every individuals` self-cognitive way of thoughts - anything can be seen as "true" even if it is "false" for mass backed logic in means of digital patterns followed by each other in a certain way which can be found reasonable for somebody .
- To make the sequence correct, the brackets need to be properly paired and nested.
